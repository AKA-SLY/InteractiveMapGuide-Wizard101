- Game-like UI split into:
  - Left: Lookup zone (Spells, Gear, Characters, Fishing) with school filters and character role filters.
  - Right: World bubbles for Wizard City, Krokotopia, Marleybone, Mooshu, Dragonspyre.
- Data is currently in-code (Fire spells, some gear, many Wizard City NPCs, early worlds).
